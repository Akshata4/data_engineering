### Data lake vs data warehouse vs data mart

A data lake is a central repository that stores raw, unprocessed, and unstructured data in its native format. This can include structured data (tables), semi-structured data (logs, JSON), and unstructured data (images, audio, video, documents)

Use case: Storing IoT sensor data, social media feeds, logs, images, and videos.

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores processed, cleaned, and structured data, typically from multiple sources, to support business intelligence and analytics.
Optimized for fast SQL queries and reporting.
Complex to set up and maintain, but provides a single source of truth for the organization.

Use case : Historical trend analysis and cross-departmental data integration.

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse, focused on a specific business line, department, or function (such as sales, finance, or marketing)
Contains summarized and filtered data relevant to a specific team or business unit.

Use case : Department-specific analytics and dashboards.

### Facts and Dimensions

Fact tables store numbers or measurements about business activities-things you want to count or add up, like sales amount, number of products sold, or total revenue. Each row in a fact table is an event or transaction (like a sale or an order), and it usually includes references (foreign keys) to related details

Dimension tables store descriptive information that gives context to those numbers, such as customer names, product details, dates, or store locations. These tables help you answer questions like "Who bought the product?", "What product was sold?", or "When did the sale happen?"

Fact tables = numbers and results.
Dimension tables = details and descriptions that explain those numbers

### Types of Fact Tables
Fact tables in data warehousing come in several types, each designed for specific analytical needs and data scenarios. The main types are:

1. Transaction Fact Table
Purpose: Records individual business events or transactions at the most detailed (atomic) level.

Characteristics: Each row represents a single event (e.g., a sale, an order, a click).

Measures: Typically fully additive (can be summed across all dimensions).

Example: A sales fact table where each row is a single sale, including date, product, customer, and sales amount.

2. Periodic Snapshot Fact Table
Purpose: Captures the state of business metrics at regular, predefined intervals (e.g., daily, monthly).

Characteristics: Each row summarizes key metrics for a specific period, not individual transactions.

Measures: Usually semi-additive (can be summed across some dimensions, like product or region, but not time).

Example: A daily inventory table that records the end-of-day stock levels for each product.

3. Accumulating Snapshot Fact Table
Purpose: Tracks the progress of a business process that has a clear start and end, recording milestones as they occur.

Characteristics: Each row is updated as the process advances through different stages (e.g., order placed, shipped, delivered).

Measures: Often records durations or counts at each stage.

Example: An order fulfillment table that tracks each orderâ€™s progress from placement to delivery, with columns for each milestone date.

4. Factless Fact Table
Purpose: Captures events or relationships between dimensions where there are no numeric measurements.

Characteristics: Contains only foreign keys to dimensions, no measures.

Example: A table recording student enrollments in courses (which students enrolled in which courses), or tracking attendance at events.

### Fact Types in Data Warehousing

This document describes the types of facts typically used in data warehousing and business intelligence systems. Understanding these fact types is crucial for designing effective data models and ensuring accurate reporting and analysis.

#### Fact Type Table

| Fact Type     | Can Sum Across All Dimensions? | Example                         | Note                                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Additive**      | Yes                           | Sales Amount                     | Can be summed across all dimensions such as time, product, or store. |
| **Semi-Additive** | Some only                     | Account Balance                  | Can be summed across some dimensions (e.g., account), but not others (e.g., time). |
| **Non-Additive**  | No                            | Profit Margin, Percentages       | These should be aggregated using averages or ratios rather than summed. |

#### Definitions

- **Additive Facts**: These can be summed across all dimensions in the data model. They are typically numeric values like revenue, quantity sold, etc.
  
- **Semi-Additive Facts**: These can be summed across some dimensions, but not all. A common example is account balance, which can be summed by account or product but not reliably over time.

- **Non-Additive Facts**: These facts should not be summed at all. Instead, they require different types of aggregation such as averaging or ratio calculations. Examples include percentages and margins.

### Usage Tips

- Use **Additive** facts for transactional data and summary reports where totals are meaningful.
- Use **Semi-Additive** facts with caution, ensuring the correct dimensions are used for aggregation.
- Use **Non-Additive** facts with appropriate aggregation logic (e.g., weighted averages) in reporting tools.
